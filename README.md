Note: This game is a VR game. Therefore, you can play this game with your VR device connected to a windows computer.      

Note: If you unzip and open the Unreal project, you need to open "StartPage" to start the game from the main menu.

Note: I had a video of the game that was recorded before this project was not completely finished. We could not record the final version of the project because the VR device we used at school had expired. Therefore, the video named "Game Video" does not include the final version of the game. Again, due to the same situation, we could not test the final version of the game, but we hope it works without any problems.

The details of the given project assignment are as follows:

Final Project      
The game portrays Ulubatlı Hasan, a fictional character in the conquest of Istanbul in 1453. Ulubatlı Hasan, fighting alone and receiving significant wounds, climbed on top of a tower on the wall and plant the Ottoman flag, and became a martyr there. In the game, you have to fight against the Byzantine soldiers with Ulubatlı Hasan and get the key to the tower's gate. After getting the key, you kill the soldiers you encounter while climbing the tower one by one and plant the last flag.
